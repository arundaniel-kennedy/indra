        Two slices of bread taste well, but it’s more profound when we add cheese or jam, that’s how our Social Media Wing works. We will address all the issues and fill the pits carving our way to success. Jeff Bezos once quoted, “If you make customers unhappy in the physical world, they might each tell 6 friends. If you make customers unhappy on the internet, they can each tell 6,000 friends.”<br /><br />

  This wing is meant to humanize one’s communication and make it more approachable. But our sole purpose would not be of spreading awareness but also to groom the youth and instil a sense of conscious responsibility in them towards the compound development of our nation. People today converse and act more on the internet world than in the physical world, thus our NGO is shouldered with Social media wing to reach out to a maximum no. of individuals to express our objectives and bring like-minded people under the same umbrella to work for VISION-2025.<br /><br />

  People fail in life when they are not aware about their capabilities and do not have 100% clarity on what they want from themselves. Many of us are not aware of our rights, duties as mentioned under our constitution. We even fail to take the best use of Government Policies which are meant to benefit us just because of mere ignorance. To keep one vigilant and updated with modern issues happening world-wide and study it affects, our wing believes to take proactive steps like blogging and launching videos on our YouTube channel. This will set the platform for us to act upon more precisely. We will be using various platforms like our Facebook page, Instagram Page, YouTube channel and WhatsApp groups to spread awareness and know the ground reality so that we address the need of time appropriately.<br /><br />

  Working with our own objectives this wing is also supposed to assist other wings like Green Wing, Technology Wing and Service Wing to reach out to population and make work done to all possible extent. Many a time the situation is not the same as shown on news channels or shared on social media platforms as on the ground zero. And as we have working individuals from each part of nation we promise for spreading the right content and give you the reality check of the issue. When the problem is clear to us then we would even diversify our role with time and work in collaboration with other organizations as well. We would also voice the thoughts of every citizen to alarm the Government of its role towards its public. We will be watchful of all mis-happenings conducted in the name of our organization and curb the menace from the root level.<br /><br />

  People are occupied by plethora of activities and thus they prefer to get information in a simple and short time. Thus, this wing highlights the ill-practices of society in easy to understand and ready to act upon via short films and creating memes. We as nation are having the working force as human resources to work globally and prevent further degradation of our surroundings. We have people as heads of many organization and now it’s time to work for our nation development. We will be regularly monitoring our progress and be accepting your valuable ideas to implement in our vision towards the nation development.<br /><br />

  Our task force is dynamic to evolve all possible ways to meet the needs of the time and welcomes YOU all to be the ambassador of your thoughts to make them reality.<br /><br />
